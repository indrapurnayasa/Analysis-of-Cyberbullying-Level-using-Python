## üßπ Data Preprocessing

The following steps were applied to preprocess the raw tweets:

1. **Remove Punctuation:** Stripped unnecessary symbols to clean the text.
2. **Lowercase Conversion:** Unified case sensitivity.
3. **Tokenization:** Split sentences into individual words.
4. **Slang Replacement:** Converted informal or slang terms into formal equivalents using a predefined dictionary.
5. **Save to MongoDB:** Preprocessed data was saved for further analysis.

## üß† Classification Process

1. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Used **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert text into numerical vectors for model input.

2. **Model Selection:**
   - Implemented **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classification.
   - Tuned hyperparameters to optimize performance.

3. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Achieved an accuracy of **85%** during evaluation on the test set.

## üìä Results and Insights

- **Dataset Analysis:**
  - Keyword-based collection ensured relevant tweet samples.
  - Distribution of cyberbullying levels was balanced after preprocessing.

- **Model Performance:**
  - The SVM classifier performed reliably with the TF-IDF feature representation.
  - Preprocessing significantly improved classification results.
